# Active Context

## Current Focus

Implementing local-first data management with Supabase and Legend State

## Recent Changes

- Created database schema for habits and check-ins
- Implemented Row Level Security policies
- Set up Legend State with MMKV storage
- Created TypeScript types for database schema
- Implemented local-first data operations
- Implemented reusable HabitForm component with add/edit modes
- Added FAB state management using Legend State
- Improved form validation and type safety

## Active Decisions

1. Database Structure

   - Using UUID for primary keys
   - Implementing soft deletes
   - Adding proper indexes
   - Setting up RLS policies

2. Local-First Implementation

   - Using Legend State for reactivity
   - MMKV for persistence
   - Real-time sync with Supabase
   - Offline queue management

3. HabitForm Component

   - Made HabitForm reusable with 'add' and 'edit' modes
   - Added proper TypeScript types and validation
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Integrated with FAB state management

4. FAB State Management
   - Implemented using Legend State
   - Added actions for open, close, and toggle
   - Integrated with form components
